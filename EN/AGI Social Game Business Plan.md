### Executive Summary
- **Project Name**: AGI Social Game
- **Project Objective**: To achieve comprehensive development of AGI by building AGI infants in a social game based on innate intelligences using the internal sensation iteration method.
- **Funding Requirement**: $10 million, including one-time costs of $1 million and annual operational costs of $2 million, sustained over 2 to 4 years.
- **Project Products**: AGI social game and AGI patents.
- **Customer Profile**: The AGI social game targets individuals without survival pressures (such as students and white-collar workers); AGI patents are aimed at robotics companies.
### Industry Status
- **Current Status**: Current AI technology has achieved specialized applications in many fields, but AGI, as a technology that truly simulates human intelligence, is still in the early stages of development.
- **Peer Behavior**: Although many companies have attempted to achieve AGI through AI in strategy games, none have succeeded.
- **Project Advantages**: The main reasons for other companies' failures include the lack of social aspects in games, AI learning mechanisms that differ from humans, and the absence of template AIs as a learning base. Our project will address these issues. (Appendix 1)
### Gaming Market Analysis
- **Target Customers**: Aimed at those with a need for respect (virtually everyone) and, due to high pricing, primarily targeting those without survival pressures.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compared to games like The Legend of Zelda and EVE, our game will offer fully intelligent NPC interactions and countless spontaneously formed social orders, with players having innate abilities superior to regular NPCs, enhancing players' sense of immersion and superiority.
- **Revenue Model**: Profits in the online virtual universe through subscriptions, skin sales, and transaction taxes; offering rental services for private virtual universes.
- **Projected Revenue**: Expected annual net profits of ten billion dollars. (Appendix 3)
### Robotics Market Analysis
- **Target Customers**: Robotics companies in need of AGI solutions.
- **Revenue Model**: Profiting through patent licensing.
- **Market Size**: Broad application demands including companion and household robots, with a market size exceeding one trillion dollars. The patent fee market is one-tenth of the customer market.
- **Projected Revenue**: Total profits expected to reach the trillion-dollar level. Capturing 100% of the AGI patent fee market.
### Development Plan
- **Development Path**: Initially establish a social game with only innate AIs within six months, expecting annual revenue of ten million dollars. Subsequently, achieve AGI within eighteen months, with revenues ranging from billions to trillions.
- **Current Progress**: Possesses strong logical analysis capabilities and programming knowledge, has successfully developed games, and holds groundbreaking research capabilities and achievements in cognitive science (psychology). (Appendix 2)
- **Challenges and Strategies**:
    - **Environment Programming**: Anticipates massive code volume, requiring recruitment of a professional team of engineers and designers.
    - **Self-awareness**: Will use the internal sensation iteration method to develop AGI, requiring self-awareness (internal sensation capabilities). Hundreds of related documents and case studies are prepared to support the iteration process.
### Team Introduction
- **Project Founder**: Holds 90% equity, with a multidisciplinary educational background and extensive programming experience, has successfully operated columns on thinking methods online, and developed forums and games.
- **Current Staff**: Two programming-capable philosophers with self-awareness capabilities.
- **Angel Investor**: Holds 10% equity. Invested one million RMB two years ago.
- **Recruitment Plan**: Plans to recruit about twenty programmers, designers, and researchers with backgrounds in philosophy/psychology.
- **Financing Plan**: Seeking to raise $10 million in exchange for 20% equity.
