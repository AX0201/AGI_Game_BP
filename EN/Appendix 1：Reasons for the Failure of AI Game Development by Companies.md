#### Companies Developing AGI Through Games
**Google DeepMind**  
Developed game AIs for "Go" and "StarCraft," defeating top human players.  
Unique perspective on AGI: AGI may not necessarily need a physical, real-world body. The core of AGI is learning how to learn, and we should observe how AGI evolves over time.
**Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence**  
Discussed "Open World Game AI" and "Multi-Agent Systems in Open World Environments" at the OWA-2024 conference.
**Others**  
Many companies have attempted to achieve AGI through AI in strategy games.  
For example, they developed a game with two roles: attacker and hider. The attacker needs to find the hider, who uses buildings for concealment.  
After millions of training rounds, both attackers and hiders became smart; hiders would pick up items to build defensive walls, while attackers used feints and quick turns.  
Both roles developed a certain level of generalization ability. When entering similar game environments, they only needed "a few thousand" rounds of training to master it.  
However, they had no clue on how to further enhance generalization abilities and eventually abandoned the effort.
#### Reasons for Failure
The reasons include three aspects: sociality, learning mechanisms, and template AIs.
### Sociality
AGI should originate from social games, not strategy games.  
Social games refer to games with at least dozens of differentiated roles and include deprivation.  
Deprivation: In the world, the ability of the rich is to give, while that of officials is to deprive. Deprivation is the core of society.

**Sociality in Modern Games**  
Go involves only two agents, non-social.  
CSGO has more than ten agents, but lacks differentiation, thus non-social.  
Stellaris has multiple agents but lacks differentiation, thus non-social.  
"Conqueror's Blade" features hundreds of agents with two roles: lords and commoners. Too few roles and no exploitation, thus non-social.  
EVE has millions of agents, dozens of differentiated roles, and several forms of exploitation (taxes, monopolies, permadeath), making it a social game.

**Aside: Shortcomings of EVE**  
EVE lacks NPC agents and does not feature the "NPC Guardian" role. This prevents EVE from cultivating AGI.  
The absence of NPC agents means the majority of EVE players belong to the lower social strata, which is painful. Our game will ensure that the majority of players belong to the middle or upper strata, with most lower strata occupied by AGI-NPCs.
### Learning Mechanisms
AGI should be like infants, not adults.  
AGI's learning should be acquired, not innate.  
AGI's learning should involve "believing X will lead to Y, but unsure, executing X, and indeed achieving Y, leading to pleasure" rather than supervised learning.
### Template AI
In social games, there should be a large number of innate AIs (i.e., adults) as templates for the acquired learning of AGI infants.  
Without templates, a society purely of infants can easily develop abnormally. Even if we observe societal abnormalities, we cannot determine if there is an issue with the AGI algorithm, which hinders iterative research.  
Certainly, some companies have considered social games but rejected them due to the lack of templates.
