#### Overview
Born in 2000, I am now 24 years old, male, and Chinese. 
I possess strong logical analysis abilities and excel in learning and thinking methodologies. 
I have knowledge and research experience in hundreds of disciplines including philosophy, mathematics, psychology, computer programming, neuroscience, sociology, economics, and education.
#### During School
From a young age, I enjoyed thinking and reading extensively beyond the school curriculum. 
I pondered the meanings of reading, life, and emotions, and my desire for discussion grew with my thoughts. I talked with my classmates—who thought I was crazy—and with elderly neighbors who shared their views with me. 
I did not prioritize schoolwork because I did not see the point of schooling. My parents suggested I attend medical school to become a doctor, so I began reading medical books in advance. I believed that academic performance before high school was irrelevant, as long as I could enter high school, because that's what affects college entrance exam scores, which in turn affect admission to medical school and the possibility of becoming a doctor. 
Thus, I spent little time on school assignments. My time was primarily spent conversing with people of various ages and professions, learning about the world. 
Despite this, my strong thinking and learning abilities ensured that my grades were not poor. I maintained a rank within the top ten in my class during elementary school (out of fifty students) and was among the top hundred in my district during middle school (out of over a thousand students). 
In high school, I attended a high school affiliated with Peking University and began studying seriously. By the end of my first year, I ranked first in my grade (out of over a thousand students) and was identified as a "Peking University seed." 
In my second year of high school, I dropped out. 
Because I had found the meaning of life.
#### Self-Learning Phase
Evolution. 
The universe evolved from barrenness to single-celled organisms, to multicellular organisms, to large animals, to monkeys, and then to humans. The mission of the universe is evolution; monkeys are meant to evolve into humans, and humans are meant to evolve into superintelligence: namely, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
The wheel of history rolls forward, and the fulfillment of this mission will not be hindered by individuals. Even if Einstein had died young, someone else would have discovered relativity.
My purpose is to fulfill humanity's mission: to realize Artificial General Intelligence.

When solving problems, I am accustomed to addressing the overarching issues—that is, directly solving a category of problems of which the current problem is an instance. 
To achieve AGI, I first needed to address its overarching challenges. I unexpectedly found it somewhat difficult to clearly define these challenges. After two years and numerous versions, I independently developed a theoretical framework which I call "Universal Information Processing." This approach, through localization, definition, categorization, and analysis, can address any question (though possibly at a high cost). 
It is not only the overarching challenge for "how to implement AGI" but also for all questions in the form "how to solve problems." It is the ultimate challenge. 
I published this theory in a paid column on the internet, releasing some applications for free on social media. The column earned 300,000 RMB in one year (in China, the average monthly salary is 3,000 RMB. This was more than my parents earned in decades). 
This strong positive feedback reinforced my conviction that I could achieve AGI.

Philosophy is stigmatized in China, labeled as "neurotic" or "studying meaningless things," which is why I had never delved into it before. 
After my column became popular, many readers remarked that my views resembled many philosophical ideas. This led me to explore philosophy and I was amazed to find it meaningful, especially logic and analytical philosophy.
I read many philosophical books. Many ideas coincided with my own, and I felt my theory surpassed the textbooks, especially in "localization." 
Localization: For example, the localization for "eating" is "a person eats some food." During definition, one cannot define the word but only the localization. For instance, one cannot define "intelligence" but can define "an object possessing intelligence" or other localizations of intelligence.
#### Programming Phase
Based on universal information processing, I analyzed how to implement AGI, arriving at:
- First, clarify the human way of thinking, which can be identified through introspection.
- Second, translate this way of thinking into code.
Introspection Method: An improvement on the "Contrast-Explanation" method.

**Contrast-Explanation** method:
- First, collect a large number of cases formatted as "a person performs a certain action under certain conditions," where the conditions are the same but the actions differ.
- Second, gather more information about these individuals (e.g., long-term and short-term history, current status) to explain the reasons for their actions. Explain all behaviors in the format "innate algorithm + acquired information," where everyone's innate algorithms are identical.
- Third, collect more cases to look for counterexamples. If counterexamples are found, modify the explanation.

The **introspection** method adds two points:
- For each case, ensure I have sufficient understanding of the person in the case—enough to "put myself in their shoes and replicate their action."
- Before explaining, meditate and observe "the fleeting thoughts that passed through my mind just before I acted." Use the results of meditation to aid in explanation.

Thus, I learned programming while deconstructing cases using the introspection method. 
Over four years, I deconstructed thousands of cases. Some were posted on social media, with over ten receiving tens of thousands of likes and hundreds receiving thousands of likes each.
My explanations were more fundamental than those in psychology textbooks, which often resort to innate explanations that are not universal, have exceptions, and only generally match the behaviors described. My explanations were universal, without exceptions. 
I also mastered Unity game programming, software architecture, game planning, numerical planning, and graphic design.
I independently developed a small Steam game with over 20,000 lines of elegantly structured code, capable of developing such a game in a week.
#### Investment Phase
Considering potential unforeseen events, I modified the "introspection method" to the "Introspection Iteration Method."

**Introspection Iteration Method**: 
Every ability a person has, every action they take, is underpinned by only two factors: innate and acquired (experience). The moment all innate factors are defined is the moment AGI is realized. 
Based on this, through "starting with an initial innate state, quickly verifying whether it is correct, and if not, adjusting it closer to correctness, then verifying again..." we can determine all innate factors. This is the Introspection Iteration Method. 
The Introspection Iteration Method requires only three conditions:
1. Accurately predict "what a being with the same innate algorithm as humans, possessing certain experiences, will not do in a given environment." The more specific the knowledge of the experiences and environment, the more "actions not taken" can be predicted. At the limit, by taking the complement of the set of "actions not taken," the "only action taken" can be deduced.
2. If it is predicted "what a being with the same innate algorithm as humans will not do in a given environment," and a being whose innate algorithms and experiences I know (K) performs this action in that environment, then I can deduce a detail of the innate algorithm T, satisfying "this human action has T as an innate factor, and K's innate algorithm lacks T."
3. A social game environment based on innate templates, which can run at "one second on Earth, a thousand years in-game," with comprehensive historical records, allowing programmers to review millennia of history down to individual histories.
Conditions 1 and 2 are already met; only 3 is lacking, which can be quickly completed with sufficient funding. Thus, I need investment.
