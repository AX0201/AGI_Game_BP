### Game Project: Virtual Universe
Virtual Universe, a social open-world game.
### Problems with Traditional Open-World Games
Traditional open-world games can be divided into four categories:
1. Exploration open-world games like The Legend of Zelda, Genshin Impact.
2. Action open-world games like Elden Ring, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.
3. Building open-world games like Minecraft, Terraria.
4. Social open-world games like EVE, Kenshi.

The problem with the first and second categories is: the entire world actually has only one intelligent agent, which is the player. Other NPCs have no intelligence, do not autonomously affect the world, and only serve the player. This results in a feeling of loneliness in these games. 
The thrill comes more from completing challenges rather than gaining friendships, respect, or recognition.

The problem with the third category is: although the multiplayer version allows for multiple intelligent agents in the world, these agents lack differentiation and exploitation, with limited interaction and dependency. Everyone plays their own game, and cooperation is limited.
This causes these games, if multiplayer, to struggle to maintain player enthusiasm after the initial novelty wears off.

The problem with the fourth category is: existing games are just starting out and are not truly social open-world games.
EVE lacks NPCs, leading to most players being at the bottom layer, suffering. Our game will give players special talents compared to NPCs, allowing most of the bottom layer to be NPCs and most players to rise to the middle or upper layers through their efforts. 
Kenshi's NPCs lack sufficient intelligence, not only are they not AGI, but even their behavior trees are incomplete, needing the system to forcibly refresh their money and food periodically to keep them alive.
### Non-AGI Social Open-World Game
About six months after obtaining investment, I will complete and release a non-AGI social open-world game. This game will far surpass Kenshi, achieving at least ten million dollars in revenue (Kenshi's revenue exceeded ten million dollars). 
I will use behavior trees to endow AI NPCs with many human traits, such as: 【If an NPC's personality is not disciplined, then they will slack off when unsupervised】【NPCs will behave randomly for the first three months after birth (100 hours of Earth time, 25 hours at 4x speed). If they receive negative feedback for slacking off during this random behavior, their personality becomes disciplined; if they receive positive feedback, their personality becomes cunning】. Players can nurture NPC infants, whose personalities are not disclosed and are hidden fields. 
These human traits are written using behavior trees, which are not very helpful for AGI research but are not without benefit. They can enhance template AIs, facilitating future AGI's mimetic learning. (AGI algorithms will definitely not be written this way; they will not exhaustively enumerate personalities. Personality is not a field of intelligence but a macro manifestation of the memory bank + decision algorithm.)

EVE is an MMO, Kenshi is single-player. My released game will blend both: there will be an official server, as well as private servers (the server owner can play solo or host a multiplayer session). 
To prevent source code leaks, private servers will only be allowed to rent servers from my company, not purchase the code to set up local servers. Rental is charged by the hour, with 90% of all earnings in the private server belonging to the server owner, and 10% to our company. 
On the official server, the revenue models include: subscriptions, skins, and transaction taxes.
- Subscription: Players without a subscription have the same attributes as NPCs. Players with a subscription receive boosts and other rewards (like the superpowers of a novel's protagonist), making it easier for them to reach middle or upper social strata.
- Skins: Pay For Love.
- Transaction Tax: Players can deposit money into their accounts (and withdraw), then trade game items for money in-game, with a trading system as developed as EVE's. Listing tax is 0.05%, and transaction tax is 3%.
### AGI Social Open-World Game
Once AGI research is successful, I will release the second-generation virtual universe game. 
In this game, I will allow AGI to evolve autonomously; they will invent their own languages and scripts, create countless new customs, cultures, and political systems, and write books. 
This will shake the world, making major corporations realize we have developed AGI, coming to buy patents. (We will register patents in advance) 
It will also shock gamers globally, even those who do not play games will rush into this game. Because this is not a game, but a world. 
Again, there will be both official and private server versions. This game will generate annual revenues of over ten billion dollars; AGI patent fees could even reach a trillion dollars.
