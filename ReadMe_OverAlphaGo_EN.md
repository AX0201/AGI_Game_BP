General Artificial Intelligence must be born in social games, not strategy games.
General Artificial Intelligence must be based on transcendent achievements in cognitive science, not on neural networks.
I research AGI using the method of introspective iteration. I possess cognitive science achievements that transcend the era.
I have spent seven years preparing, researching analytical methods, learning programming skills, and researching cognitive science. Now everything is ready, only held back by the volume of programming work.
I need money. Invest ten million dollars in me, and I give you 20% equity; or, hire me as the project director for an annual salary of five million dollars, you provide the staff, and I take 50% of the profits from my project, with the highest decision-making power belonging to you.
  
Introspective Iteration Method:
Every ability a person possesses and every action they take is influenced by only two factors: innate factors and acquired factors (experience). The moment all innate factors are defined is the moment AGI is realized.
Based on this, by starting with an initial innate state, quickly verifying whether it is correct, and if not, making it closer to correct, and then verifying again... This is how all innate factors are determined. This is the introspective iteration method.
The introspective iteration method requires only three conditions:
1. Be able to correctly predict "what a being with the same innate algorithm as humans will not do in a given environment when possessing certain acquired experiences." The more specific the knowledge of the experiences and the environment, the more "actions not taken" can be predicted. At the limit, by taking the complement of the set of "actions not taken," the "only action taken" can be deduced. (Example: A boastful bully tormenting classmates will not repent due to their moralistic criticism, but might show repentance due to the classmate's retaliatory and moralistic criticism.)
2. If it is predicted "what a being with the same innate algorithm as humans will not do in a given environment when possessing certain experiences," and a being whose innate algorithms and experiences I know (K) performs this action in that environment, then I can deduce a detail of the innate algorithm T, satisfying "this human behavior has T as an innate factor, and K's innate algorithm lacks T."
3. Have a social game environment based on innate templates, which can operate at "one second on Earth, a thousand years in-game," and have comprehensive historical records, allowing programmers to view millennia of history down to individual histories in both macro and micro perspectives.
